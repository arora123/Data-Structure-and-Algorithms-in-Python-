# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-in-Python-
This Repository contains codes for Data Structure and Algorithms implementation in Python with some interesting use cases and exercises.

tree data structure part_1.py

1. Create a general Tree for a website with methods for
	--> Insert/add_child
	--> get_level for preety printing
	--> print_tree for printing complete tree
	--> print tree upto a certain level


tree data structure part_2.py

1. Create a general Tree for an organization chart with two atrributes/inputs (name & designation) and methods for
	--> Insert/add_child
	--> get_level for pretty printing
	--> print_tree for printing complete tree
	--> print tree upto a certain level
	--> level order traversal a certain level
	
	
binary serach tree part_1.py

1. Create a Binary Search Tree with methods for
	--> Insert method
	--> In-Order, Pre-Order and Post-Order Reversal
	--> Search method
	--> Find Max and Find Min Functions

2. For the list of elements [10, 22, 14, 20, 25, 30, 16, 16, 30], create a binary search tree and answer the following.
	--> In Order Traversal of elements
	--> Pre Order Traversal of elements
	--> Post Order Traversal of elements
	--> Verify your answers by using simulations here: https://yongdanielliang.github.io/animation/web/BST.html
	--> Maximum number from the abouve list
	--> Minimum number from the above list

3. In the list of courses ["R", "Python", "Machine Learning", "Statistics", "Excel"], search for "Machine Learning" and "Big Data" using binary search tree
